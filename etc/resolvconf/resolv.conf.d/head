# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
# 127.0.0.53 is the systemd-resolved stub resolver.
# run "systemd-resolve --status" to see details about the actual nameservers.

# this method is ineffective than only using the 
# systemd-resolved when the first one of the dns in /etc/resolv.conf is dead,
# in this case, the apps will try the first one and than using
# the second and so on.

# while using the systemd-resolve based method to maintain the 
# internal list of dns servers will be more effective when one of them 
# is dead.
# in this case, the systemd-resolve will automatically select
#  the first one which is live for using and remember it till
# it is unavailable in the future.
#nameserver 127.0.0.1
